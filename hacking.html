                <p> Cross-site scripting attacks are those in which attackers inject malicious code, usually client-side scripts, into web applications. Because of the number of possible injection locations and techniques, many applications are vulnerable to this attack method. These kind of attacks differ from another web application vulnerabilities because they attack an application’s users, not an application’s infrastructure, but they can still cause a great deal of damage. XSS attacks involve three parties as follows The attacker, The victim, The vulnerable web site that the attacker exploits to take action on the victim. Out of the three parties, the victim is the only one who actually runs the attacker’s code. The website is just a vehicle for an attack and is not typically affected. An XSS attack can be carried out in a number of ways. As an example, the attacker sends the victim a maliciously crafted URL through e-mail or some other medium via web. When the victim opens the URL in a Web browser, the Web site renders the page and the script is executed on the victim’s computer.

               <li> <h3> A technique that a lot of SQL injection beginners don’t know </h3>
                 <p> Hey there! Back again with another article about SQL Injection techniques.
    So, I’ve been seeing a lot of beginners in SQL Injection. While they try to extract data from the database, they ignore the fact that they can do better.
    Note that I don’t have any bad intention to destroy any website or any organization. This post is only for educational purposes.
    The problem:
    The problem with beginners is, they extract data only from the current database in which the vulnerable query is getting executed. They don’t even try to access other databases and their content. So, a lot of intermediate and advanced SQL injectors might be aware of the fact that if the query is executed with proper privileges, the attacker can access other databases on that SQL server.
    So, let’s actually take a look at how it’s actually done. </p>
